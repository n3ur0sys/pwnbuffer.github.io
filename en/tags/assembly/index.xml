      <description>What is assembly? Link to heading Assembly is a low-level programming language, it is written to communicate directly with the processor hardware. Unlike high-level languages, such as the famous Python, assembly operates close to machine code, the famous binary! Each assembly instruction generally represents a single CPU operation, such as moving data between registers, performing arithmetic operations or controlling the flow of execution.&#xA;Assembly is not universal!! It depends directly on the processor architecture.</description>
